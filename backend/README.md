## API Documentation
I am using Swagger which is one of the most applauded specification for documenting REST API.It specifies the format (URL, method, and representation) to describe REST web services. It provides also tools to generate/compute the documentation from application code.

Access the API document using `http://localhost:3000/swagger` once the server is started.
